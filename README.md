# EZTRIM-Gen3
Evolution of Gen2 with webbing connection
With this design I have created a new interface for the rope : a webbing will be fixed by a shaft and 2 screws and the rope will be attached to the webbing
There are at this stage 2 configurations of models :
- EZTRIM Gen3 ring with 2 webbing interface
- EZTRIM Gen3 ring with one webbing interface and one arch interface for connecting the rope directly
